QKspace (pronounced "quick space") is a minimalistic knowledge base for small teams.

It is perfect for creating a course reference base for an educational organisation, for making a QnA list in the IT, for exchanging knowledge within social work teams, for making a thematic list of personal quotes and notes.

# Installation

```
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
sudo apt-get install libmagickcore-6.q16-dev
```
**Install Redis**  

on development(local) Ubuntu  

- `sudo apt-get install redis-server`

Check installation  
- `redis-server -v`

on production(remote) Ubuntu

**Running Sidekiq in production using Systemd**  

To setup a Sidekiq Systemd service, you need a service configuration file. An example file can be found in the [Sidekiq github repo.](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/tree/master/examples/systemd)
- Copy this file to your server and place it in `/lib/systemd/system` There are two lines here that require adjustment to your settings;
  1. The working directory path, change this to you application path, for example:  
  `WorkingDirectory=/home/deploy/my_app/current`
  2. The `ExecStart` path. This specifies the path and command to start Sidekiq. Now this could be different depending on your settings and ruby version managers (if you use one).
  For example:  
  `ExecStart=/home/deploy/.rbenv/shims/bundle exec sidekiq -e production`
- After setting up configuration, enable the Sidekiq service with:  
  `sudo systemctl enable` 
  
- Other commands:  
  ```
  systemctl stop sidekiq  
  systemctl start sidekiq
  systemctl restart sidekiq
  systemctl kill -s TSTP sidekiq # quiet
  ```
  
**Change swap size in Ubuntu 18.04**  

To generate OGImages, recommended to increase size of the swap file  
In the following example, we’ll extend the swap space available in the /swapfile to 8 GB
- Turn off all swap processes
  - `sudo swapoff -a`
- Resize the swap
  - `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1G count=8`  
      *if = input file  
      of = output file  
      bs = block size  
      count = multiplier of blocks*  
- Make the file usable as swap
  - `sudo mkswap /swapfile`
- Activate the swap file
  - `sudo swapon /swapfile`
- Check the amount of swap available
  - `grep SwapTotal /proc/meminf`
